# ATR-IR-to-OCS
This project successfully used the Fresnel equations and single-scatter theory to convert the ATR-IR spectrum of the sample from the Sheffield Dermatology Research Group to the OCS spectrum，the ATR spectrum is generated with 10 bounces. The samples studied in this process included water and human skin, and the ATR prism used was diamonds. Both samples used the optical coefficient of water at 6000nm as the real part of the refraction index, which is close to the coefficient of skin, then used to get the absorbance coefficient by the Fresnel equation and Beer-Lambert law. The scattering coefficient is extrapolated from the current scattering data in NIR to generate the power exponential function theoretically. The backscatter coefficient is inferred from the relationship between the total attenuation coefficient at 1300nm. The OCS spectra were obtained by integration calculations. The obtained OCS spectra have stronger OD values than the ATR spectra. For example, the highest peak of the water’s OCS spectrum is up to 2.7 at 3250 cm-1, whereas in the previous ATR spectrum it was only around 0.76. Besides, the skin’s OCS spectrum absorbance value increases to 6 times the ATR spectrum absorbance value. The waveform displayed by the OCS spectrum amplifies the smaller absorption peaks in the ATR spectrum, and the entire waveform is more obvious while narrowing the gap between the maximum and minimum absorption peaks.
